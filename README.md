# LaBella_Lab_Posters

Scientific posters should drive home the point of our research in less than 5 minutes. I've placed a draft poster here for you to work off of if you choose. 

Components that are critical to have in your poster are

- Informative title
- Logo of university or program
- Picture of you with your contact information
- BIG figures
- LARGE font
- Acknowledgements and citations
